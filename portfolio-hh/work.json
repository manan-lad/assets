      "about": "I developed a gesture-based control system for VLC Media Player using YOLOv3. The model was trained on two distinct hand gestures, converted to TFLite for efficiency, and integrated into a Python script. This setup enables seamless hands-free playlist navigation, enhancing accessibility and user experience.",
